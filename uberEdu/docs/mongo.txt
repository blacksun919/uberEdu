Install mongoDB
Go to mongoDB official site to download zip file for Windows, and unzip the contents to anywhere you like. MongoDB will read data at \data\db by default, but mongoDB won’t create this folder for us, so we must create it by ourself, you can create this folder in Windows Explorer, or type the following command in terminal:
  C:\> mkdir \data
  C:\> mkdir \data\db
After creating \data\db, double click mongod.exe in your_mongodb_path\bin or type the following command in terminal to turn on mongoDB:
  C:\> cd your_mongodb_path\bin
  C:\> mongod
Then you can double click mongo.exe or type the following command in terminal to get into administrative shell:
  C:\> cd your_mongodb_path\bin
  C:\> mongo
Congratulations!!! You’ve successfully installed node.js and mongoDB on Windows!!!
